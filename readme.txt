All metadata for the Univeristy of Melbourne/AGOS seismic network can be found in this directory.


The complete files containing metadata for all stations can be found in this level of the directory in the files named 'UOM.filetype'.




Each different metadata file format has also been given its own sub-directory, each of which contains the following files:


		- Metadata files for each of the individual stations

		- a 'UM_network.filetype' file containing metadata for our surface network (network code UM)

		- a 'BM_network.filetype' file containing metadata for our borehole network (network code BM)
