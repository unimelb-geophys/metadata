LOCU.xml is the same as all other xmls in this folderm, but the description contained within the data has been updated.

Instead of having blank descriptions, it now reads as fllows:


<InputUnits>
	<Name>M/S</Name>
	<Description>Velocity</Description>
</InputUnits>
<OutputUnits>
	<Name>COUNTS</Name>
	<Description>Digital counts</Description>
</OutputUnits>

**description of one of the other fields has been changed from "Acceleration in metres per second per second" to simply "acceleration"
